# ofp.sam.vast.utils

 Utility and wrapper functions to accompany the following R packages, James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST and James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils, so that VAST works for applications using WCPFC tuna fisheries data: standardization of fisheries dependent data across large spatial areas.

 The utility functions are meant to interface with James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST (3.2.2) and James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils (2.3.4).
