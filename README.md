 Utility and wrapper functions to accompany the following R packages, James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST and James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils, so that VAST works for applications using WCPFC tuna fisheries data: standardization of fisheries dependent data across large spatial areas.

 Version 1.0.0 contains the accesory functions from the private ndd.vast.utils package that were used in the spatial.sampling.sim. These utility functions are meant to interface with James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST (3.2.2) and James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils (2.3.4).
 
Versions 1.1.0 & 1.2.0 contain the accesory functions used to create the standardized CPUE for the 2020 WCPFC stock assessments of BET and YFT. The utility functions are meant to interface with James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST (3.3.0) and James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils (2.5.0).
