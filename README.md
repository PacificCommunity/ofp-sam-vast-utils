# ndd.vast.utils
 Modifications of James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST and James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils functions so that VAST works for the data and applications that I work with: standardization of fisheries dependent data across large spatial areas. Also includes some of my general utility functions. The utility functions are meant to interface with James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST (3.2.2) and James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils (2.3.4).
