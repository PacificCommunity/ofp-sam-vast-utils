\arguments{
\item{vast.output}{The output from a fit.vast function call}

\item{n.samp}{Integer giving the number of records to plot the QQ relationship. Default is to use everyting.}

\item{seed}{The random seed for the subsampling}

\item{plot.type}{The type of metric to plot 'all', 'time', or 'knot', if you want to plot QQ by factor.
\describe{
  \item{'all'}{Observed nominal cpue by knot and timeblock}
  \item{'time'}{Predicted density cpue by knot and timeblock}
  \item{'knot'}{Predicted encounter rate by knot and timeblock}
}}

\item{palette.cols}{A color palette to use for plotting}

\item{smooth.span}{Value between 0 and 1. Degree of smoothing to use for the QQ plot}

\item{ts.start}{Integer giving the first year of the model}

\item{ts.step}{The timestep of the model 1 for year and 0.25 for quarter}

\item{save.dir}{Path to the directory where the outputs will be saved}

\item{save.name}{Name stem for the output, useful when saving many model outputs in the same directory}
